# Codecademy Portfolio Project: Mixed Messages

## Keep in mind

Purpose of 'Keep in Mind' is to press the button and will generate a quote to keep in mind during day or the journey, also a suggestion to try something new, for now I am suggesting 'food', will implement different categories, on late versions, and also will give you your 'Lucky number'.

### Technology apply:
